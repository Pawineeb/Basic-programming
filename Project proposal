Project topic: Understanding the local electricity market (Datacamp competition)

Background and inspiration:

Electricity is becoming general use for our everyday gadgets such as cell phones, computers, robots, electric cars and some medical wearable devices, other than in the industrial. Solar power plants and solar power panels are becoming important energy generator, generating directly from the sunlight source. More residencies are looking forward to decreasing their electrical pay by reaching solar energy.

A solar cell is made of p-type and n-type silicon. The near junction of two layers n-type electron move into the holes on p-type layer, creates an area around the junction called the depletion zone in which the electrons fill the holes. When the sunlight strikes a solar cell, electrons in the silicon are ejected forming of holes. Connect the two silicon layers with metallic wire, the electrons will travel and create a flow of electricity.

Solar panel receives energy from the sunlight and converted into electricity. Meanwhile, the amount of energy produced depends on some factors such as the panel orientation and weather. Even though solar panel work more efficiently on the cold weather, summer which is the sunniest weather and has fewer clouds is more likely to produce electricity. In the raining season, cloud might obscure the sunlight, but rainstorm washout the panel dusts so they are able to produce more energy.

From Datacamp competition, the company build solar panel arrays and they sell the energy to industrial customers. Now they will expand sales to the city of Melbourne. They want to estimate energy prices for the next 12-18 months to negotiate with their customers and for their research strategy in storage capacity. Their plan is to store some of the energy produced by the solar panels when pricing conditions are unfavorable and sell it by the next day.
